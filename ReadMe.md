 - performance is terrible

yet it has most of the market share in a market of highly opinionated software developers

# Perfect tech stack

Perfect tech stack like a perfect partner. It just does not exist, so lets get to work

# Technical Confidence:

Technical confidence comes from one of two things: ignorance or experience

# Complicated Software:

When does Software/Your code base starts to get complicated/Messy? 
- Immediately after someone says this feature can be implemented in one hour

# Copy Paste

Copypaste is the fastest way to create bugs.

# STD
 what does STD mean in Software Development? Scrum Transmitted (mental health) Diseases

# Cloud

what are clouds made of? Linux servers mostly!

# Technical debt
Any feature that does not get traction from user is a technical debt and should be removed.

# Good software jokes?
Why good software jokes are so rare?

Because first good software needs to exist before we can joke about it.

# Index 1

# Software Testing

Which months in the year has 28 days?

all of them. Most of them have more than 28. Thats how bugs in production happen.

# VIM

:smile

# Speed

Rookie engineers worry about runtime speed too much.

Seasoned engineers worry about development speed.

Code is more often read than it is written

# Git

quote from anonymous git user:
"Whenever I see a door with push sign, I pull first to avoid conflicts or push rejection"

# Java

Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#!

with the amount of merchandise big tech gives
like cup, cap, hoodie, t shrt, etc

Laid off employees would have harder time forgetting about the company than their Ex.

# Struggles of a developer

half of the struggle in SW dev is believing you can solve problem at hand

# TDD and BDD

why TD or BDD is better?
Programming without BDD is trying to learn piano when sound comes a day later after you have pressed the key.

# Testing

‚Äì We don't write tests.
‚Äì Why?
‚Äì Because we don‚Äôt have time for it.
‚Äì Why?
‚Äì Because there is too much work and pressure.
‚Äì Why?
‚Äì Because we don‚Äôt move fast enough.
‚Äì Why?
‚Äì Because changing software has become difficult and risky.
‚Äì Why?
‚Äì Because we don‚Äôt write tests.

Amount of logging in production code is inversely prootial to number of tests writte

# Complicated but Simple:

Keep these 2 laws in mind:
‚Ä¢ It's simple to make things complicated.
‚Ä¢ It's complicated to make things simple.

# AutoDeployment

People discussing if there should be a hold between staging and production autodeployment
TODO MEME here

# What your choice of data structure says about you

Array: You're a classic, no-BS kind of person who values simplicity and speed.

Linked list: You're a risk taker who likes to live on the edge and push the boundaries.

Binary tree: You're a perfectionist who seeks balance and order in everything you do.

Stack: You're organized, methodical, and enjoy IHOP

Heap: You're ambitious and always aiming for the top, even if it means getting a little messy along the way.

Graph: You're a creative problem solver who thinks outside the box and loves exploring new possibilities.

Trie: You're a wordsmith who knows how to handle complexity and make sense of even the most convoluted data. 

# Done and almost done
In Software Development there is a massively huge difference between done and almost done

# Special Cases
In programming the special cases are not special enough to break the rules

# Simple and Complex
Simple is better than complex, complex is better than complicated

# Code fast and faster code
You can either code fast or produce faster code

# Now and never
Now is better than never
Although never is often better than now.

# Debugging
its a modal mystery when you are the detective and the person who committed the crime.
