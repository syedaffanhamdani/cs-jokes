# One liners

why sql developer looks at the sky at night? They like to count (\*)
Why do girls like python more than java? because Python does not treat them as objects
Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.
What is object oriented way of becoming rich? // Inheritance
What is difference between C and C++? // 1

Its online, its offline. What is it? // service worker

# The weird JavaScript

## typeOf NaN is a number

typeof NaN; // “number”
NaN == “number”; // false
NaN == number; // false

## Nan is not equal to NaN

NaN === NaN; // false

## string?

“This looks like a string”

## Number()

Number(); // returns 0
Number(undefined); // returns NaN

## Null has wierd behavior

null < 0 // false
null == 0 // false
null <= 0 // true

## multiple comparative operators

1>2>3
true
3>2>1
false

# Perfect tech stack

Perfect tech stack like a perfect partner. It just does not exist, so lets get to work

# Technical Confidence:

technical confidence comes from one of two things: ignorance or experience

# Copy Paste

copypaste is the fastest way to create bugs.

# Cloud

what are clouds made of? Linux servers mostly!

# Technical debt

Any feature that does not get traction from user is a technical debt and should be removed.

# Good software jokes?

Why good software jokes are so rare?

Because first good software needs to exist before we can joke about it.

# Index 1

My wife complained that I care more about coding than her. I told her that in my array of interests, she is at [1](position 1). She was satisfied.

Rich people Like bill gates say money does not matter
Beautiful people would say that looks dont matter
Programmers say warninings dont matter

# Springboot banner

- Why would spring boot provide hide spring boot banner switch when they themselves provide the banner

# Software Testing

Which months in the year has 28 days?

all of them. Most of them have more than 28. Thats how bugs in production happen.

# VIM

:smile

# Speed

Rookie engineers worry about runtime speed too much.

Seasoned engineers worry about development speed.

Code is more often read than it is written

# Git

quote from anonymous git user:
"Whenever I see a door with push sign, I pull first to avoid conflicts or push rejection"

# Java

Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#!

Why did the Java developer go to the beach?

To catch some exceptions!

# Tech layoffs

with the amount of merchandise big tech gives
like cup, cap, hoodie, t shrt, etc

Laid off employees would have harder time forgetting about the company than their Ex.

# Struggles of a developer

half of the struggle in SW dev is believing you can problem at hand

# TDD and BDD

why TD or BDD is better?
Programming without BDD is trying to learn piano when sound comes a day later after you have pressed the key.

# Testing

– We don't write tests.
– Why?
– Because we don’t have time for it.
– Why?
– Because there is too much work and pressure.
– Why?
– Because we don’t move fast enough.
– Why?
– Because changing software has become difficult and risky.
– Why?
– Because we don’t write tests.

Amount of logging in production code is inversely prootial to number of tests writte

# Complicated but Simple:

Keep these 2 laws in mind:
• It's simple to make things complicated.
• It's complicated to make things simple.

# AutoDeployment

People discussing if there should be a hold between staging and production autodeployment
TODO MEME here

# What your choice of data structure says about you

Array: You're a classic, no-BS kind of person who values simplicity and speed.

Linked list: You're a risk taker who likes to live on the edge and push the boundaries.

Hash map: You're a performance-oriented individual who doesn't settle for anything less than optimal.

Binary tree: You're a perfectionist who seeks balance and order in everything you do.

Stack: You're organized, methodical, and enjoy IHOP

Heap: You're ambitious and always aiming for the top, even if it means getting a little messy along the way.

Graph: You're a creative problem solver who thinks outside the box and loves exploring new possibilities.

Trie: You're a wordsmith who knows how to handle complexity and make sense of even the most convoluted data. 

# Done and almost done
In CS there is a massively huge difference between done and almost done
